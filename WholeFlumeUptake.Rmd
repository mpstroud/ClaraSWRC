DataInput must be run first in each new session 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2); library(dplyr)

d=unique(water$Parameter); summ_tables=list()

for (i in 1:length(d)) {
   summ_tables[[i]] =  water %>%
    filter(.,Parameter == print(d[i])) %>%
    group_by(Treatment,SampleTime) %>%
        summarise_at(vars(Value), tibble::lst(mean,min,max))
}
d; summ_tables[[2]]
#similar levels of istopic enrichment and not much change in 15N signal at plateau
#large differnces in concentrattions and total 15N Mass, differences in concentrations suggest biological-acitvity even when water leaked out of the flumes over the addition time

flume<-"R10" 
par(mfrow=c(3,1))
attach(filter(water,Treatment == paste(flume) & SampleTime == "plateau" & Parameter =="delta15N"))
plot(Value, main="delta15N",type="b")
attach(filter(water,Treatment == paste(flume) & SampleTime == "plateau" & Parameter =="NitConc"))
plot(Value, main="NitConc",type="b")
attach(filter(water,Treatment == paste(flume) & SampleTime == "plateau" & Parameter =="Mass15N"))
plot(Value, main="Mass15N",type="b")

#rather messy, I don;t see any value on measuring uptake using water data if no clear decay is observed. Perhaps we had too much release, seems consistent that concentrations are usually lowest after ~120minutes, then go back up, this turnover rate falls within previous work.
