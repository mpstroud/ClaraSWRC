<h1>Whole Flume Uptake</h1>
<p>Prior to any calcualtion I plotted each parameter over time and it really looks quite messy, no clear patterns of 15N decay or 15Nmass removal across flumes. I do see NO3  concentrations being usually lowest after ~120minutes, then go back up, this turnover rate is consistent with previous 15N work for algae, including my own work. So I gues it could be that 10h was too long and began having noise from 15N remineralization.</p>
If we have more water samples for the **first 3h** of additon I would definetly send them out
